17.* Play with the Debugger in Visual Studio

Write a program that prints at the console the numbers from 1 to 1000, each at a separate line.
You might need to learn how to use loops (search in Internet).
Set a breakpoint in the line, which prints the next number in the Visual Studio code editor.
Run the program through the debugger using the [F5] key. 
When the debugger stops at the breakpoint trace the code execution with [F10] key.
